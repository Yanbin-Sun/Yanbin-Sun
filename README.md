## 🧠 Current Work

I am currently working on emotion-conditioned diffusion models and multimodal evaluation pipelines.

My research focuses on:

- Training and adapting diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5 / Flow-based models)
- Emotion alignment in image generation
- Vision-language based evaluation and filtering
- Multimodal representation consistency

## 📊 Research Direction

I am particularly interested in:

- How emotional signals can guide generative models
- Alignment between semantic prompts and visual outputs
- Evaluation metrics for generative quality and emotional consistency
- Efficient adaptation of large-scale diffusion systems
